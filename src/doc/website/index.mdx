# Maintaining and developing this website
## Introduction

This documentation describes how to maintain and develop this website (Borealium). The website is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/borealium/borealium.org).

The purpose of this documentation is to describe the general structure of the website, how localisation functions and can be extended, key data sources that affect the website generation, and how to add or change content.

This website uses the [Lume framework](https://lume.land). For specifics of using Lume, please read their documentation — this document will only describe the specifics of maintaining this website, not all specifics about the framework used.

## Structure

The core website functionality (pages, layouts, etc) are in `src/`.

Data from Pahkat (the package management service used by Divvun) is found in the `data/` directory, alongside those
resources specified as external dependencies. The language and category data is also defined in this directory.

The language data specifies which languages are supported by the website, but also which languages are supported by the UI only 
(i.e. do not show search results for resources in those languages). The category data specifies categories that cannot be derived
from Divvun's repositories.

Plugins used by Lume are found in the `plugins/` directory. These plugins extend Lume to provide support for things such
as multilingualisation, Fluent translations, blog excerpts, etc.

## Adding content

### Quickstart

#### Adding a blog post

#### Adding a static page

#### Adding a new external resource

Each resource is defined in a separate file in `data/resources/`. The easiest is to just
copy one of the existing files, and modify the content.

**NB!** Make sure the id string does not contain anything but ASCII letters and hyphen. No
underscores, no nothing beyond ASCII letters and hyphen.

#### Adding documentation for a resource

#### Adding a new language

#### Adding a new category

Available categories are the sum of
[the ones given by Pahkat](https://github.com/divvun/pahkat.uit.no-index/blob/main/main/strings/en.toml),
and the ones defined in `data/categories.ts`. To add new categories just extend that file.

### Localisation

There are two options for localisation of content:

When creating a long prose file, such as a blog post, use an `.mdx` file (Markdown extended with TypeScript) with a special naming convention that includes the language. Consider a blog post that is
translated to English, Swedish and Finnish. Your directory structure should look like this:

```
src/post
└── 2023-08-12_beep-boop
    ├── index.mdx
    ├── index.fi.mdx
    └── index.sv.mdx
```

For predominantly static content, such as titles of sections reused on multiple pages, or other reusable strings, this website uses Fluent files. These files are composable based
on their position within the directory tree, so if an `index.en.ftl` file exists in `src/`, and an `index.en.ftl` exists at `src/foo/`, then all files in `src/foo/` will have all
the strings defined in `src/index.en.ftl` with `src/foo/index.en.ftl` layered on top.

In order to create a new Fluent translation, just create a file with the same name but a different language tag, e.g. `src/index.se.ftl`. The system will automatically detect it and use 
it where necessary.

In order to access these translations from an `.mdx` file, use the `t` function which is always accessible in that scope:

```javascript
{t("my-i18n-id")}
```

If your translation includes a variable, you can specify that like so:

```javascript
{t("some-id", { someVar: "some value" })}
```

Within `.tsx` templates, the `t` function is a child of the `page` variable.

It is recommended that the majority of the strings use the root definitions, and only using nested definitions when it makes 
sense to do so -- the goal is to promote string reuse, not clutter.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) — this is needed for validating the `.ftl` files
- Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) — this is the JavaScript engine used by Lume

### Quickstart

```
deno task serve
```

That's it! Now you have a local dev environment setup.

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code for developing this website, as it supported Deno
effectively and supplies type handling and error detection.

### Custom plugins

The below describes what each plugin is for, and is not of particular interest or use to those simply adding content
to the website.

#### `category-data`

Provides the category data to Lume pages where required. Not particularly interesting.

#### `excerpt`

This plugin generates the single paragraph summaries for the sidebar present on most pages on the website.

#### `fluent`

This plugin implements the Fluent wrappers so that `.ftl` files can be used with this website.

#### `language-data`

Provides the language data to Lume pages where required. Not particularly interesting.

#### `multilang`

This plugin implements the support for generating a separate subsite for every provided language, and implements
the fallback mechanisms that allow individual pages to fallback to the next closest translated language.

#### `outline`

This plugin generates the table of contents sidebar for documentation pages.

### Client-side JavaScript

This website uses as little client-side JavaScript as possible. There are limited exceptions to this:

- The search functionality only works with JavaScript enabled

Client-side JavaScript is injected using a `script` helper function, which converts the provided string input into the body of a `<script>` element.

Should the need for client-side JavaScript change in the future, there are techniques to embed React client-side hydration as necessary, but is currently out of scope for this document.
