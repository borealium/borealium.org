more-info-spellers =
    Most spellers in Borealium are built using the GiellaLT infrastructure, based
    on open source code. The spellers work in most macOS apps, and in MS Office,
    LibreOffice and several other apps on Windows.
    
    The spellers from GiellaLT are installed using Divvun Manager, and they are
    also kept up-to-date automatically by Divvun Manager.
more-info-keyboards =
    Most keyboards found in Borealium are built in the GiellaLT infrastructure by Divvun
    and Giellatekno. These keyboards are built for Windows and macOS automatically, and distributed
    via the Divvun Manager. Keyboards for ChromeOS must be added to our ChromeOS keyboard app.
    
    Many languages do also have keyboards for Android and iOS. These are distributed via our
    keyboard app.
